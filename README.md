On the Jetson Nano platform, use the native v4l2 API to obtain raw format images, and exploit the parallelism of the ISP pipeline, such as automatic white balance and color correction, to obtain RGB images that can be directly fed into the inference engine (or into ffmpeg for encoding) 
Project to be continue soon!
